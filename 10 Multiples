e)Joe is scared to go to school. When her dad asked for the reason, Joe said
that she was unable to complete the task given to her by her teacher. The
task was to find the “first 10 multiples” of the number entered from
“stdin”. 
import java.util.Scanner;              //these codes are same for all programs
public class acad {	
public static void main(String args[])	
{		
Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in); 		
System.out.println("Input");        		
int a = sc.nextInt();		                //input for the number to which multiples has to be found
System.out.println("Output");		 
for (int i = 1; i <=10; i++) {		      // this loop runs for 10 times	 
System.out.println(a+"x"+i+"="+i*a);	  //Prints the multiples along with the format
}	
}
}
