a)Write a Java code with the class name, “acad,” and a method called “main.”
Hard code the program with two integers and print the sum of those two
integers.

import java.util.Scanner;                         // package imports for using scanner class

public class Main {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);          //'sc' is the object of class scanner from util package.
		int a = 3;                                    // variable a is hard coded with value 3
		int b  = 2;                                   // variable b is hard coded with 2 
		a= a+b;                                       //sum should be displayed as 6 as 2+3=6
		System.out.println(a);                        // Code for printing the sum
		
	}

}
