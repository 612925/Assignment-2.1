a)Write a Java code with the class name, “acad,” and a method called “main.”
Hard code the program with two integers and print the sum of those two
integers.
public class acad {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		int a = 3;                                    // variable a is hard coded with value 3
		int b  = 2;                                   // variable b is hard coded with 2 
		a= a+b;                                       //sum should be displayed as 5 as 2+3=5
		System.out.println(a);                        // Code for printing the sum
		
	}
}
