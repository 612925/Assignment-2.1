Can you overload a method with the same return type? Explain your
answer with proper logic.
Yes We can overload methods with same return type but we have to use different datatypes for
input parameters or the number of parameter list should be different.

EXAMPLE:

	public static int sum(int a , int b,int c)
    {
         return a+b+c;
         
    }
    public static int  sum(int s ,int s1)  
    {
    return s+s1;
    }
	
both these methods have same name as 'sum' and return type as 'int' but one adds two numbers whereas other adds three nos.
This is overiding by number of parameter list passed.
